### Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pranshugupta54/content.ai.git`
2. Install project dependencies and start the development environment: <br>
In the root directory of the project (where package.json is located), run `npm install`. <br>
3. Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the backend as:
   ```bash
   API_KEY=your key
   PORT=4000
   ```
4. Start the development environment: `npm run dev` (This command, defined in your project's package.json, starts both the backend server and the client using the concurrently library. It's a convenient way to run both parts of your application concurrently during development.)
